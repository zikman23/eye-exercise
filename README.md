# Eye movement exercise

#### JavaScript Mouse Tracking Eyes
![screenshot](/screenshot.png)

## Overview

A simple exercise to demonstrate eyes tracking the mouse cursor within the browser window. The eyes were generated with CSS, and Javascript was used to track the position of the mouse cursor and move the eyes to follow along. These elements are brought together using HTML as the framework. The javascript code is able to manipulate elements of the CSS and HTML via the DOM, specifically the onmousemove Event in this case.

## How to Run

## Roadmap of future improvements

My goal is to update this project and add more detail to the artwork, such as an animated face. This will require a better understanding of CSS.

I am also exploring what other elements can be moved around using the same javascript mechanisms. Down the line, I will be exploring other javascript mouse events.

## Languages

This exercise uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
